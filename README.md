# Edward Kubiak's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I developed this site to showcase my work and share my journey as a full stack developer specializing in the MERN stack. The site is crafted using React and React-Bootstrap for responsive front-end components, supported by Node.js for back-end functionality.

## Overview

My portfolio is structured into several main components, each representing different facets of my professional and personal life:

- **Home**: A brief introduction to who I am, highlighting my key competencies and specialties.
- **About**: Detailed insights into my professional background, current endeavors, and a bit about my life outside of work.
- **Projects**: A showcase of various projects I've worked on, demonstrating my technical abilities.
- **Resume**: A detailed look at my professional experiences, educational background, and acquired skills.
- **Contact**: A section for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch with me.

## Features

- Responsive design implemented using React-Bootstrap.
- Smooth, single-page application experience with React Router.
- External links to my GitHub and Strava profiles for a professional and personal connection.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Manages routing across the portfolio without page reloads.
- **React Bootstrap**: Provides responsive design elements.
- **Node.js**: Powers the server-side logic of the site.
